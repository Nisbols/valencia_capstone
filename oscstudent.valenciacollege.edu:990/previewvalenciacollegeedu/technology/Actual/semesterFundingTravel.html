							The SAGE office has scholarship funding from the Valencia Foundation and Student Development to help offset the costs of study abroad.
							You must submit a separate application for semester study abroad. Awards range from $1000 to $3500 depending upon the number of applicants,
							the contents of your application, and the amount of scholarship dollars available for the current academic year.  
						</p>						
						<p>
							Finding the money to support a semester study abroad program can be challenging for some. The first step in the process is to create a budget.
							Use the <a href = "http://valenciacollege.edu/international/studyabroad/students/semester/documents/BudgetWorksheetforStudyAbroad.xlsx" target="_blank">Budget Worksheet for Study Abroad</a> form to help you. If you are applying for a SAGE scholarship or plan on using your financial aid,

						<button class="accordion">Click here for Financial Aid</button>
							<div class="panel">
								<p>
							Recent changes in federal law have made it possible for students to use some or all of their federal financial aid for semester study abroad.
							Full-time, Valencia students who are eligible for <a href = "http://valenciacollege.edu/finaid/gettingstarted/" target = "_blank">Financial Aid</a> can use these funds for study abroad programs that award academic credit and grades counted towards your
							cumulative GPA for study.  Eligibility is determined by the type of study abroad program you attend, as well as the type of financial aid you receive.
							Only students earning a degree at Valencia are eligible. It is important that you begin this process at least one year prior to your program start date.
							Any program for which you will not receive transfer credits or grades is not eligible for any financial aid funds. Financial aid can be used to support summer study,
							as long as you are enrolled for academic credit and you meet all other requirements. 
						</p>						
						<p>
							For semester programs, check with your academic advisor to ensure that the courses you are going to take will transfer back to Valencia.
							You will need to fill out the <a href = "http://valenciacollege.edu/international/studyabroad/students/semester/documents/ConsortiumAgreementFormforStudyAbroadv2.pdf" target = "_blank">Course Pre-Approval and Consortium Agreement Form for Study Abroad</a> before you go.
							These forms will be required when you meet with the Financial Aid Services Department.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>NOTE</i>: You cannot use financial aid for study abroad after you graduate from Valencia!
							It is important to meet with a Financial Aid Services advisor prior to accepting any scholarship money to determine if it will affect your overall financial aid package.
							Take your budget and the course approval forms to your Financial Aid Services advisor for him or her to review to determine your eligibility.
							Eligibility is determined by the type of program you attend, as well as the type of financial aid you receive.
